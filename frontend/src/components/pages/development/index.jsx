      <h3>CS 5610 Final Project</h3>
      <p>Hello, I'm Rupert, and I'm the dev.</p>
      <p>I used this final project to launch a prototype for my band website.</p>
      <p>
        If you're a TA, I have provided a login username and password in the README and on Canvas.<br />
        To make changes to the band content, a user must be logged in. Feel free to make changes as you please. <br />
        Click "Part of the band?" in the bottom right corner to be brought to the login page.<br />
        The photos and events are real from my band, and I am hoping to add a soundcloud iFrame soon. <br />
        I plan to keep this site live at this URL. It is currently being hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet.
